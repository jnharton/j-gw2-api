jGW2API - Implementation of the GW2 API library by Varonth.5830  

### Notes

This code makes use of the JSON stuff provided here: http://json.org/java/ (source code: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-java), but does not include it (i.e. you'll need a copy of that code to use it).

### Plans
I wanted to make some changes to the code provided at the google code page mentioned above and github
is a handy way to post it That the code should be under the MIT license is very convenient.
